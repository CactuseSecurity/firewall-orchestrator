# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Weâ€™re extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Hasura Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers and the Hasura team.

In case you discover a security issue/vulnerability, please contact security@cactus.de with all the details, attaching necessary information if possible.

**Do not open an issue!**

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in Firewall Orchestrator.
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Firewall Orchestrator.

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help with tuning Firewall Orchestrator components for security.
- You need help applying security related updates.
- Your issue is not security related.

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by the project's maintainers and the security team within 3 working days. 

The reporter will be kept updated at every stage of the issue's analysis and resolution (triage -> fix -> release).

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Hasura product security team and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to a few weeks. We expect the time-frame between a report to a public disclosure to typically be in the order of 7 days. The Firewall Orchestrator maintainers and the security team will take the final call on setting a disclosure date.
