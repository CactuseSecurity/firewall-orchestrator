# functional requirements
## UI
### UI general
- resizing of areas (e.g. navigation menue)
- multi-language support (start with German + English)
- cross-plattform support runs on windows, macos, linux (or browser when moving logic into webserver)
- authentication, rbac, ...
- allow for tenants (rbac per firewall device or management plus IP-ranges - at least that is the status quo)
- use symbols in menues in addition to text (e.g. oi cog)
#### multi-purpose filter
- implement as text box and graphical element in parallel
- text filter is derived and automatically displayed when clicking filters
- user is able to choose filter modules
- UI must prevent filters from being displayed that do not belong to the current data (dependencies)
- low prio: display further info per element (ip, client, manufacturer)
### reporting
- create templates that define report
- provide filter line with simple language containing logical operators
- easy to adapt (eg. add new reports)
- nfr (non-functional): modern look
- report visibility should be definable (group, users)
- nice to have: positional bar at upper edge (see nzz.ch)
- part of UI functionality must be "schedulable" (report generation)

### admin gui parts
  - add/edit/delete management
  - add/edit/delete device
  - add/edit/delete client/tenant

# non-functional requirements
- database:
  - keep database size down (e.g. clean-up jobs removing all data older than 5 years)

  - or split database into archive and live
- gui: 
  - modern look & feel
