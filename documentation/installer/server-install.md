# Installation instructions server

- use latest debian or ubuntu minimal server with ssh service running (need to install and configure sudo for debian)
- this will install various software components to your system. It is recommended to do so on a dedicated (test) system.

1) prepare your test system (install packages needed for install script and create and autorize ssh key pair to allow ssh login to localhost for ansible connect)

```console
su -
apt-get install git ansible ssh sudo
```
if not already configured, add your current user to sudo group (make sure to activate this change by starting new shell or even rebooting):

```console
usermod -a -G sudo `whoami`

exit
# from here in standard user context

ssh-keygen -b 4096
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >>.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
```

2) test system connectivity necessary for installation

test ssh connectivity to localhost (127.0.0.1) using public key auth (add .ssh/authorized_keys)

```console
ssh 127.0.0.1
```

make sure you can use ansible locally

```console
ansible -m ping 127.0.0.1
```

3) get Firewall Orchestrator with the following command

```console
git clone https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator.git
```

4) if ansible version < 2.8 (older systems like ubuntu 18.04, debian 10), install latest ansible 

       cd firewall-orchestrator; ansible-playbook scripts/install-latest-ansible.yml -K

5) install (on localhost)

```console
cd firewall-orchestrator; ansible-playbook site.yml -K
```
Enter sudo password when prompted "BECOME or SUDO password:"

That's it firewall-orchestrator is ready for usage. You will find the randomly generated login credentials printed out at the very end of the installation:
```
...
TASK [display secrets for this installation] ***********************************
ok: [fworch-srv] => {
    "msg": [
        "Your initial UI admin password is 'xxx'",
        "Your api hasura admin secret is 'yyy'"
    ]
}

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
fworch-srv                 : ok=302  changed=171  unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=127  rescued=0    ignored=0
```
Simply navigate to <https://localhost/> and login with user 'admin' and the UI admin password.

The api hasura admin secret can be used to access the API at <https://localhost:9443/>.


6) upgrade

```console
  cd firewall-orchestrator
  git pull
  ansible-playbook site.yml -K -e "installation_mode=upgrade"
```
