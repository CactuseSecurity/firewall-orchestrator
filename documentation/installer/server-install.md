# Installation instructions server

- use latest debian or ubuntu minimal server with ssh service running (need to install and configure sudo for debian)
- recommended platforms are Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS and Debian 11. See [system requirements](https://fwo.cactus.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fwo-system-requirements-v5.pdf) for supported platforms
- we will install various software components to your system. It is recommended to do so on a dedicated (test) system.

1) prepare your target system (make sure your user has full sudo permissions)

```console
su -
apt-get install git ansible sudo
```
if not already configured, add your current user to sudo group (make sure to activate this change by starting new shell or even rebooting):

```console
usermod -a -G sudo `whoami`
```

2) get Firewall Orchestrator with the following command (as normal user)
```console
git clone https://github.com/CactuseSecurity/firewall-orchestrator.git
```

3) Operating specific ansible adjustments
  - Ubuntu 18.04, Debian 10: install latest ansible before firewall orchestrator installation:

        cd firewall-orchestrator; ansible-playbook scripts/install-latest-ansible.yml -K

4) install (on localhost)

```console
cd firewall-orchestrator; ansible-playbook site.yml -K
```

Enter sudo password when prompted "BECOME or SUDO password:"

That's it. Firewall-orchestrator is ready for usage. You will find the randomly generated login credentials printed out at the very end of the installation:
