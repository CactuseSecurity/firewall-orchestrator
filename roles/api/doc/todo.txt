i) use http://json2html.com/#getstarted to convert json results from api calls to html tables?

todo:
- define role based access model:
  - full admin (able to change tables management, device, stm_...)
  - fw admin (able to document changes)
  - reporter (able to request reports)
- add authentiation & authorization
- expose (track) only necessary tables - and use ansible to do so
   see: https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/how-it-works/metadata-schema.html - is it possible to add data to hdb_table
        isodb=# select * from hdb_catalog.hdb_table;
		isodb=# \dt hdb_catalog.*
		                    List of relations
		   Schema    |          Name           | Type  |  Owner  
		-------------+-------------------------+-------+---------
		 hdb_catalog | event_invocation_logs   | table | dbadmin
...
		 hdb_catalog | remote_schemas          | table | dbadmin
		(13 rows)
		
		isodb=# select * from hdb_catalog.hdb_table where table_name='rule';
		 table_schema | table_name |                                                                            configuration                                                                            | is_system_defined | is_enum

		 public       | rule       | {"custom_root_fields": {"delete": null, "insert": null, "select": null, "update": null, "select_by_pk": null, "select_aggregate": null}, "custom_column_names": {}} | f                 | f

- decide if dependency on postgres when using hasura is ok --> yes
- hasura only supports cidr as string - should not be a problem --> ok
- PoC: build usage report
- get config at a certain date not just the active config
- define some queries & mutations
- let someone build a client
- define query that resolves all groups
- make run natively without docker --> not necessary
- test performance with fits import
- find out how to handle tenants (users able to see only certain managements & devices)
- decide whether to drop client views (filter based on ip addresses) within a rulebase
- get rid of rule_order table or at least reduce it
- find a way to delete all old data (>x years)
