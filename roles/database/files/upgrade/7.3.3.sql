Documentation of RBAC for tenant filtering

- tenant to device mapping is stored in tenant_to_device and tenant_to_management tables
- we need to make sure that the mapping is complete (e.g. no devices are visible if the management is not visible)
    - this also means we need a mechanism to set new gateways to fully visible if the management is fully visible!
      this is done in the settings after selecting the exact three-way visibility
    - new gateways and managements start with "not shared" if the management's visibility is "not shared" (only when added via UI)
    - new gateways start as "invisible" if the management's visibility is "shared"
    - new managements start with no visibility for a tenant
    - invisible means not visible for a tenant user (e.g. reporter) but needs to be visible for the admin in the tenant settings!

    alternatively it would be possible to just set management as fully visible to result in all (future) gateways of the management to be fully visible as well
    but then the API filtering would become much more complex
- use the same mechanisms for tenant simulation as reporter_view_all and admin as for restricted reporter:
  - not all filters can be applied in API (especially not for object vie in RSB) due to performance issues
  - this works as long as reports are generated and stored in the archive and the reporter has no direct accesss to the API
- API access is restricted via tenant_filter as follows:
    - device table:
        {"_and":[{"mgm_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-managements"}},{"dev_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-devices"}}]}
    - management table:
        {"mgm_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-managements"}}
    - rule table:
        {"_and":[{"mgm_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-managements"}},{"dev_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-devices"}},{"rule_relevant_for_tenant":{"_eq":"true"}}]}
    - rule_to table:
        {"_and":[{"rule":{"mgm_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-managements"}}},{"rule":{"dev_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-devices"}}},{"rule_to_relevant_for_tenant":{"_eq":"true"}}]}
    - rule_from table:
        {"_and":[{"rule":{"mgm_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-managements"}}},{"rule":{"dev_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-devices"}}},{"rule_from_relevant_for_tenant":{"_eq":"true"}}]}
    - object: (no restrictions on objgrp, ...)
        {"mgm_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-managements"}}

- rules and rule_from/to are fetched using the computed fields defined by functions
    - rule_relevant_for_tenant
    - get_rule_froms_for_tenant
    - get_rule_tos_for_tenant

- Question: do we actually need to include the computed fields get_rule_froms_for_tenant, ... in the queries or can all of this be steered by API permissions and we just use the normal fields (rules, rule_tos, rule_froms)?
    Anser: for the simulation of tenants (by admin/reporter-viewall role) we need these functions as we do not have API restrictions
    - the function get_rules_for_tenant is needed to be able to simulate getting rules for a specific tenant

- we are introducing a new quality of visibility (visible, shared visible, fully visible (not shared)) for gateways and managements
    - these visibilities are inherited from management to gateway: when a management is fully visible then all the gateways are also fully visible

- we do not add more information to the JWT, just whether the device is visible or not:
    x-hasura-visible-devices: { 1,4 }     --> shared and not shared gateways
    x-hasura-visible-managements: { 3,6 } --> shared and not shared managements

    NOT implemented:
        x-hasura-fully-visible-devices: { 1 }
        x-hasura-fully-visible-devices: { 6 }

            then depending on the grade of visibility we either return a rule(base) unfiltered or filtered
                    {"_and":["_or":[{"mgm_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-managements"}},{"dev_id":{"_in":"x-hasura-visible-devices"}}]}
